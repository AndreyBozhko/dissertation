%%% Comment or uncomment any or all of the following packages as

%%% The standard AMS math packages
\usepackage{amsmath, amsfonts, amssymb, amsthm, esint, subfig, textcomp}


%%% For diagrams and "pics." Tikz is probably a better choice...
\usepackage[all]{xy}

%%% For hyperrefs, breaklinks might cause problems (or not really help with
%%% long hyperrefs...) 
% Uncomment the following two lines and change "allcolors=black" to
% "allcolors=untgreen" to get UNT branded green hyperlinks
\usepackage{color}

%%% For professional tables (as in the appendix), comment out if there are

\usepackage{booktabs, caption, multicol}


%%% Uncomment the following line to get the computer modern equivalent of

%\usepackage{cmbright}
%%% Uncomment the following line if line spacing is funky when the last line
%%% is uncommented.
%\usepackage[standard-baselineskip]{cmbright}

%%% Cleveref plays nicely with amsthm and likes to be the last package to be

%%% This loads the main style file.
\input{UNTdissertation.sty}

%%% If you need the hypcap package, uncomment the following line
%\usepackage[all]{hypcap}

%%% Choose REFERENCES or BIBLIOGRAPHY (Roughly speaking, choose "REFERENCES"
%%% for a reference list: there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence in
%%% plain English) between citations in the text and the list of sources in
%%% the REFERENCES; choose "BIBLIOGRAPHY" if not all the sources listed in
%%% the BIBLIOGRAPHY are cited in the text, for example say you were
%%% inspired by the discussion between Milo and the Dodecahedron in The
%%% Phantom Tollboth.) 
%%% References are more common in scientificky texts.

%%% Make your own macros and put them in macros.tex.
\input{macros}

%%% Uncomment the following line and add the basename of the chapter file
%%% (for example chapter1 for chapter1.tex) to have LaTeX process only
%%% chapter 1. This probably isn't as relevant now as it was when computers
%%% had slower processers and less memory, but if you are running tex on
%%% your smartphone, it might come in handy

%%% This makes the title page ...
\maketitle

%%% a copyright page
\include{copyright}

%%% An acknowledgments page (called acknowledgments.tex), this can be

%%% Uncomment the following to generate lists of tables or figures. 
\listoftables
\listoffigures

%%% Now for the actual dissertation -- the mainmatter.
\mainmatter

%%% This helps LaTeX to break a display across two pages in some
%%% circumstances. If it's commented out, the number of underful pages will
%%% probably go up (and the text will be distributed evenly on the
%%% underfilled pages, not pushed to the top).
\allowdisplaybreaks
  
%%% Include the chapters here.

\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}
\include{chapter3}
\include{chapter4}
\include{chapter5}

%%% Uncomment if there are appendices. This command sets some things up in
%%% preparation for the actual appendices.
\appendix

%%% Include appendix "chapters" here. A single appendix should start with
%%% \appchapter*{TITLE} rather than \chapter{TITLE}. This supresses the 
%%% numbering (if there is only one appendix it doesn't rate a number). If
%%% there is more than one appendix, use \appchapter to get numbered
%%% appendices (A, B, C, ...).  
\include{appendix}

%%% This starts the backmatter, which so far is only the bibliography.
\backmatter

%%% This modifies some bits of the amsplain bibliography style to conform
%%% with UNT/TGS requirements.
\bibliographystyle{modifiedstyle}

%%% Include the .bib file containing the bibliographic information (in
%%% BiBTeX format...). ``bibliography.bib'' is a descriptive name for a
%%% bibliography file in BiBTeX format.
\bibliography{bibliography}{}


%%% That's all folks!
